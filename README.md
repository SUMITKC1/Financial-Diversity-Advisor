# **FINANCIAL DIVERSITY ADVISOR**

**"Diversification is protection against ignorance. 
It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.-Warren Buffet"**  
A smart dashboard to help users diversify investments with confidence.

---

## 🔍 **Overview**

The **Financial Diversity Advisor** is a machine learning-based tool designed to democratize access to smart investment strategies. It assists users—regardless of financial expertise—in building diversified portfolios based on real-time data and personalized inputs such as **age**, **investment amount**, and **risk tolerance**.

> Traditional financial advisors can be expensive and generic robo-advisors often lack deep personalization. This dashboard fills the gap with customized, dynamic asset allocation insights.
